SceneGraph Checklist

Things that HAVE to be DONE:
 - Rotate and Scale in the Transform class
 - Inverse matrix algorithm (and apply it to the camera)
 - Support for more lights 
 - Textures
 - Meshs
 - Manipulator (get the code) - add it to the camera class
 - The environ class
 - Normals
 - Cut both the sphere and the cube into pieces for the lighting to work
	properly

Things that HAVE to be CHANGED:
 - Transform class must not use OpenGL to multiply matrices
 - Returns have to be handled correctly
 - The scene.render function must not call setLights or setCamera (alternatives?)

Things that will be cool:
 - Finish the matrix class and use it
 - Separate rendering from the actual graph (hard one)
