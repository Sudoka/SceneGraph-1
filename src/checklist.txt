SceneGraph Checklist

Things that HAVE to be DONE:
 - Inverse matrix algorithm (and apply it to the camera)
 - Textures
 - Meshs
 - The environ class
 - Normals
 - Cut both the sphere and the cube into pieces for the lighting to work
	properly

Things that HAVE to be CHANGED:
 - Transform class must not use OpenGL to multiply matrices
 - Rotation is a bit screwed up (I have to set up a way for the object to rotate around itself)
 - Lighting is not close to work (gulp)

Things that will be cool:
 - Finish the matrix class and use it
 - Separate rendering from the actual graph (hard one)
